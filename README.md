# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms 1.1

Welcome to **Data Structures and Algorithms 1.1** –
a structured vault for notes, implementations, and solved problems gathered during my DSA learning journey.

---

## 📌 What you will find here

✅ **Structured Notes**
Concise explanations of core data structures, algorithms, and key patterns with examples.

✅ **Data Structure Implementations**
Clean, testable Python (and potentially C++/Java) implementations of:

* Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
* Trees and Binary Trees
* Heaps
* Graph Representations
* Stacks, Queues, Deques
* Sorting and Searching algorithms

✅ **Problem Solving Archive**
A dedicated folder accounting for problems solved over the years:

* LeetCode
* Codeforces
* AtCoder
* Custom handwritten problems
* Pattern-based practice

and many more sources.....

## 🚀 Why this repository?

This repository serves as:

* A **revision vault** before coding interviews.
* A **clean reference** for DSA implementation syntax.
* A **growth tracker** showcasing progress across years.
* An **open learning resource** for anyone seeking clean, understandable DSA materials.
